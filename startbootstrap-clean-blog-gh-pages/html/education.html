                        <p>I've always considered my pursuit of knowledge to be near the top of my list of priorities. Second only to things at the level of importance such as God or family. Although I value the knowledge that a formal education provides, my desire for learning extends far beyond textbooks and classrooms. </p>
                        <p>My road through university has been rather windy, beginning with me majoring in Neuroscience for a time, before a brief 18 month intermission to serve a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Upon my return I switched my pursuits to that of an English degree. I thoroughly enjoyed those classes, but ultimately decided Experience Design and Management was the major best suited for what I'm hoping to accomplish in life. </p>
                        <p>Experience Design and Managament teaches students the creation, facilitation, and management of designing experiences at all levels. I believe experiences change lives for the better. I hope to use this degree to help my children, communities, and corporations build confidence in themselves and their God-given and developed abilities. </p>

                                     As the Program Assistant at Aspen Grove I do a little bit of everything. I have organized events for those applying to work here over the summer, as well as helped to plan and coordinate different events and activities that will take place during the summer. I also help with the logistics of organizing the students who will be working here - such as scheduling interviews</li>

                                     As the logistics coordinator on the committee for BYU Student Alumni's Senior Celebration, I helped coordinate logistics of the event.</li>

                                     As a College Liaison for BYU's Choose To Give fundraiser, I have been the point of contact between BYU Student Alumni and BYU College of Humanities, as well as BYU's Kennedy Center. I help develop and maintain a good relationship between the different colleges and BYU Student Alumni. I help them come up with ideas for and organize creative events to get students involved, and to raise money for students attending their specific colleges.</li>
                                 <li><span class="bold underline">Program Director BYU Leadership Summit|BYU Student Alumni - Provo, Utah|08/2020 - 02/2021</span> <br>
                                     As a Program Director for the BYU Leadership Summit I first helped to organized a committee of hand-selected individuals with different skills to work together to make the Summit happen. I managed program operations and provided leadership opportunities for my committee. Together we reached out to accomplished BYU alumni to speak at our event, adapted when everything switched to virtual instead of in-person, planned creative ways to facilitate audience participation, organized the broadcasting specifics, sold tickets to, and advertised the event, and then documented the whole process in an organized folder to be used for the same event next year.</li>

                                     Similar to being the Programs Director for the BYU Leadership Summit, I organized a committee, and then managed the program operations for said committee.</li>

                                     As a coach for BYU's sports camps, I helped the BYU women's tennis coach organize different drills and games for the attendees to participate in. I then worked with other coaches to run the kids through the drills, giving them advise for ways they could improve their tennis game. We would divide the kids into teams, and throughout the week of their attendance encourage and help them develop leadership skills and unity within their teams through various competitions.</li>

                                     As visitors center missionaries, we were the face of the Church to those who attended the Winter Quarter's visitors center. I mastered the material of the museum in which I served, and then used this material to teach tour groups about the history of Winter Quarters, and more about the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It was my responsibility to develop personal connections with each person whom I took on tour, and fit the material of the museum to be specifically interesting and uplifting to them.

                                     I was a member of BYU's Women's tennis team before leaving on my mission in December of 2017.</li>
